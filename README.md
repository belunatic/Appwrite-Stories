# Appwrite Stories

Appwrite Stories is a project designed to help developers learn and explore the Appwrite platform. Through this project, you will gain hands-on experience with Appwrite's features and capabilities, enabling you to build and manage backend services for your applications efficiently. Whether you are new to Appwrite or looking to deepen your understanding, this project provides practical examples and stories to guide your learning journey.

## How It's Made:

_Tech used: React, Tailwind, CSS, appwrite_

The project leans more into exporing and understanding the features and capabilities of appwrite as a platform. My Project is about users being able to create a story / post and also being able to view all the other stories the other users have created. It allows the user to edit and delete their own strories but not of the other users. All this is made possible once you login.

## Optimize

Building this as a frontend web app, appwrite didnt have ap1 to access all the users in the database, this can only e achieve when building a web app with server side connection. Also this being a 2 day hackthon, I was not able to mae the adjust to make this possible. I hope you enjoy it for what it is.

## Lesson Learned

Being able to use appwrite platform and see what all the other possible project I can accomplish with it, is what I have learnt in this project I am looking forward to explore more of it.
